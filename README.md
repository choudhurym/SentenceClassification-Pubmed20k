# SentenceClassification-Pubmed20k
This is a small project where we used 20k labeled abstracts from the PubMed 200k RCT (randomized controlled trials) dataset containing 2.3 million labeled sentences and classify them into 5 classes including objective, background, method, result, and conclusion using a convolutional neural network (CNN).
